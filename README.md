to be fair i do not know what the heck I am doing, but i am going to write down what I learned so far.

How to push and pull your branches.

step one, create a repository on your git hub.

step two, copy the SSH link.

step three, create a folder in your own working computer and then boot up vs code.

step four, in your vs code, load your created folder and then open its terminal.

step five, in terminal, type 'git clone (paste your link after clone). let the 64 bit friend do its job.

step six. go to your cloned file. either by command direcory (cd) or just killing the terminal and opening the cloned repository's terminal.

step seven. type in 'git branch newbranch' in the terminal. and you would be able to create a new branch.

step eight, type "git switch newbranch' to switch to a new branch. same can be said about main but its typed as 'git switch main.'

step nine, after creating your css and html file, type in 'git add .' which adds all the files.
